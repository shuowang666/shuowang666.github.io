I am **Haoyang He (何昊阳)**. I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Zhejiang University in China and expect to graduate in 2027. My advisor is Professor [Lei Xie](https://person.zju.edu.cn/leigh). Currently, I'm interning at Tencent YouTu Lab, Shanghai, mentored by Researcher [Jiangning Zhang](https://zhangzjn.github.io/). 

My main research interest is **Anomaly Detection**. In the past I have used diffusion models ([DiAD](https://github.com/lewandofskee/DiAD)) as well as Mamba models ([MambaAD](https://github.com/lewandofskee/MambaAD)) for multi-class anomaly detection.
